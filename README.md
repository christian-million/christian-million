# About Me

By day, I'm a Data Analyst at [Yosemite Community College District](https://www.yosemite.edu). Nights and weekends, I like to develop my programming and computer science skills in any way that I can.

I am always interested in opportunities that would allow me to volunteer my time and skills - especially open source projects and project that support underserved communities. The open source community has provide immeasurable value to my skill set (and subsequently [my professional endeavors](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianmillion/)) and I love to give back where I can.

# Languages / Interests

I've developed most of my programming skills through the context of Data Science, Decision Support, and Research. So Databases, R, Statistics, Data Analysis, Business Intelligence, Automated Reporting, and Communication are where I thrive. As such, my programming toolkit is pretty typical of a Data Analyst:

- The [R Programming Language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is my bread and butter, so I'm always happy to contribute to any R projects that I can.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) is always fun to dive into.

- Database Technologies

- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)

- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) / [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) / [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)

- Many others...
